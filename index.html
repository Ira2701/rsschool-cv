    <h2>About Me</h2> 
    <p>
    After graduation, I was sent for the distribution to MAZ (Minsk Automobile Plant). However, over a six-month period, I had an understanding of dissatisfaction with the need for development and self-identification at the current place of work. So, I made a decision to take courses for the subsequent change of the field of activity or to use that skills for the development in the current field of activity.</p>
    <p>I know that a mathematical mindset, logical thinking, hard work and a desire to change the field of activity will help me to overcome the difficulties of learning and understanding work processes as well as in becoming a competitive Frontend Developer. </p>
